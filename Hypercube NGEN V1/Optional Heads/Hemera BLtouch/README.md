Hemera for HEVO NGEN first generation by pipersw on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4695196

Based on "E3d Hemera Mount for Precision Orion Piezo - Hypercube Evolution - HEVOHemera Piezo Orion for NGEN first gen"

I design my own head for E3D Hemera/ Trianglelabs matrix extruder for the HEVO NGEN first generation.

The fan shroud is just take from "5015 Hemera Fan Shroud with BLTouch bracket" https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4588159

The Offset position of the bltouch will be: X-24.50 Y-44.00 Z-0.95

The Hemera model is from "E3D Hermes / Hemera CAD (V6&Volcano)" https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4025946

The Matrix extruder is more or less a clone of the hemera extruder. The position of the nozzle is not exactly the same.
